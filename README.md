# Data-Visualization-Project

Discovering hidden patterns and connections between various dataset features through data visualization is becoming more and more helpful in predicting challenging events. For a huge dataset to be visually appealing, these relationships and patterns are essential. An adult income dataset—a popular unbalanced machine learning dataset—was employed for this project.

The purpose of this project is to use a dataset including demographic data to develop a profile for a college marketing team. The college will be able to meet its enrollment target with this profile. The correlations between an individual’s various demographic factors will be found in this report. These results will be used to construct a compelling and educational profile that will assist in suggesting a main demographic group for college enrollment.
